While all organizations should be ethical and transparent in their conduct,
Christian organizations should hold themselves to an even higher standard. In
Titus 2:7-8 (ESV) Paul urges Titus, a Christian leader, to live this way:

> Show yourself in all respects to be a model of good works, and in your
teaching show integrity, dignity, and sound speech that cannot be condemned,
so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us.

This is what drives us to see Christian organizations improve. We want to be
above reproach not to avoid injury, but because we represent Christ.

## What We Believe

We believe that the entire, canonical Bible is the actual words of God and that
it is completely sufficient guidance for the Christian to live a life that
honors God.

We believe that humanity was created directly by God for God's glory.

## Our Goals

We want Christian organizations to be open, transparent, honest, and above
reproach in their practices and partnerships. We want employees of these
organizations to act in a way that reflects the character of Christ who is our
model for all things. Organizations are composed of individuals, and no
organization is good in and of itself. It is good when it is composed of
good people.

While we call on leaders of Christian organizations to act Biblically, our
primary mission is to educate all members of these organizations so that change
can be effected from within.
