{"name":"Open Culture Initiative","tagline":"Promoting open and ethical cultures in Christian organizations.","body":"While all organizations should be ethical and transparent in their conduct,\r\nChristian organizations should hold themselves to an even higher standard. In\r\nTitus 2:7-8 (ESV) Paul urges Titus, a Christian leader, to live this way:\r\n\r\n> Show yourself in all respects to be a model of good works, and in your\r\nteaching show integrity, dignity, and sound speech that cannot be condemned,\r\nso that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us.\r\n\r\nThis is what drives us to see Christian organizations improve. We want to be\r\nabove reproach not to avoid injury, but because we represent Christ.\r\n\r\n## What We Believe\r\n\r\nWe believe that the entire, canonical Bible is the actual words of God and that\r\nit is completely sufficient guidance for the Christian to live a life that\r\nhonors God.\r\n\r\nWe believe that humanity was created directly by God for God's glory.\r\n\r\n## Our Goals\r\n\r\nWe want Christian organizations to be open, transparent, honest, and above\r\nreproach in their practices and partnerships. We want employees of these\r\norganizations to act in a way that reflects the character of Christ who is our\r\nmodel for all things. Organizations are composed of individuals, and no good\r\norganization is good in and of itself. It is good because it is composed of\r\ngood people.\r\n\r\nWhile we call on leaders of Christian organizations to act Biblically, our\r\nprimary mission is to educate all members of these organizations so that change\r\ncan be effected from within.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
